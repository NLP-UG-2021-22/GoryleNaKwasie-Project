# Little cook's helper

It is a student final year Web Development project. We combined front end programming languages to create a new cooking coach.

## About this app

It's a food website which will help you find the recipes for a breakfast, dinner or desserts. It's mainly targeted for students searching for quite cheap and not sophisticated meal. You can filter your serach by any ingeredients you have in your kitchen so that you don't have to go to a shop. 
Additionally we added innovative step by step instruction mode: you can now use a voice readout in order to avoid touching the screen when your hands are covered in flour. 

## Features
